                    <p class="purpose">Purpose: The purpose of this project was to build a professional and personalized
                        portfolio website to showcase my educational background, skills, projects, achievements,
                        services, and online presence — all in one place.</p>

                    <p class="description">This portfolio website is a fully responsive, SEO-optimized static site
                        developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features multiple pages including Home, About,
                        Projects, Achievements, Resume, Services, Teaching, Social, Contact, and Blog. The design is
                        minimal yet impactful, with a fixed sidebar for easy navigation and a clean layout for
                        readability. <br>

                        The site includes a custom hero section with typewriter animation, dynamic sections for featured
                        work, student testimonials, and integrated contact options (WhatsApp, call, email, etc.). It
                        also serves as a mini platform for promoting my edtech venture ZodeTech, offering access to
                        resources and student programs. <br>

                        This project reflects my design sense, frontend expertise, and dedication to providing value
                        through digital presence.

                    <p class="responsibility">
                        I developed this portfolio website entirely on my own as a static site using HTML, CSS, and
                        JavaScript. From design planning to coding each section — everything was done independently to
                        reflect my personality, skills, and professional journey.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Challenges Fased</h4>
                    <p class="outcome">Since it was a static website and I had a clear plan in mind, I didn’t face any
                        major challenges during the development.</p>

                    <h4>Learning Outomes</h4>
                    <p class="outcome">
                        Through this project, I improved my frontend development skills, deepened my understanding of
                        user interface and responsive design principles, and learned how to organize large amounts of
                        content in a clean, navigable format. It also helped me explore better SEO practices, structure
                        my achievements for a professional audience, and establish a unified digital identity that
                        highlights my roles as a developer, instructor, and mentor.

                    <p class="purpose">Purpose: It focuses on creating a private workspace for each user to track,
                        update, and organize tasks without interference — useful for students, professionals, or small
                        teams.</p>

                    <p class="description">he Task Manager is a user-specific web application that allows individuals to
                        securely log in and manage their daily tasks from a dedicated portal. Once logged in, users can
                        add, edit, mark as complete, or delete tasks as per their needs. Each user has an isolated
                        dashboard where all tasks are stored and updated in real-time. <br>

                        This project aims to help users stay organized, track their daily responsibilities, and maintain
                        productivity in both personal and professional workflows. Features like deadline setting, status
                        toggling, and priority tagging were included to enhance usability and task visibility.

                        includes functionalities to calculate 1’s and 2’s complements of binary numbers and perform
                        arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division across different
                        bases. <br>

                        This project serves as a practical aid for students studying computer architecture, digital
                        logic, and programming fundamentals.
